# Problem Statement & Scope

## ❓ Problem Statement
Have you ever tried to explain something urgent—like a medical emergency—but no one could understand you? It’s a terrifying thought, but for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing community, it’s often a daily reality. While Sign Language is a rich and natural way to speak, most of the hearing world simply doesn’t know it. This creates unfair barriers in hospitals, classrooms, and even just hanging out with friends.

Right now, the only real solution is hiring a human interpreter, but they can't be everywhere at once. I built this project because I believe communication should be free and easy. It’s an AI tool that uses a simple webcam to translate sign language into text instantly—no expensive equipment required, just code connecting people.
## 🎯 Scope of the Project
The goal of this project is to build a Real-Time Indian Sign Language (ISL) Detector.

* What it does (In Scope):

Recognizes static, single-hand gestures for ISL alphabets (A-Z) and numbers (0-9).

Works in real-time using just a standard laptop webcam.

Includes image processing to handle different lighting conditions in a room.

* What it doesn't do (Out of Scope):

It does not yet recognize dynamic gestures (movements or full sentences).

It currently focuses on one-handed signs, not complex two-handed gestures.

It is a desktop application, not a mobile app (yet)

## 👥 Who is this for?
* The Deaf Community: To help them communicate independently with people who don't know sign language.

* Beginners Learning ISL: Students can use it to practice their signs and get instant feedback on whether they are doing them correctly.

* Public Service Staff: Receptionists or bank tellers could use this tool on their counters to assist deaf customers

## 🚀 Key Features
* Instant Translation: The system watches the hand and prints the corresponding letter instantly, removing the need for a human translator for basic spelling.

* Smart Guidance: It draws a "Blue Box" on the screen to show the user exactly where to place their hand for the best results.

* Confidence Score: It doesn't just guess; it tells you how sure it is (e.g., "80% confident") so you know if the translation is reliable.

* Runs on Any Laptop: I optimized the code to run smoothly on a standard CPU, so you don't need a powerful gaming computer to use it.
