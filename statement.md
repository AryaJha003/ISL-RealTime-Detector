# Problem Statement & Scope

## ❓ Problem Statement
Imagine trying to explain a medical emergency or ask for directions, but no one understands you. This is the daily reality for millions of people in the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. Sign language is their natural way of speaking, but because most of the general population doesn't understand it, they face a massive communication barrier in schools, hospitals, and social settings.
Currently, bridging this gap requires human interpreters, who aren't always available. My project addresses this by creating a digital tool that can automatically translate sign language into text, making communication accessible to everyone without needing expensive equipment.

## 🎯 Scope of the Project
The goal of this project is to build a Real-Time Indian Sign Language (ISL) Detector.

* What it does (In Scope):

Recognizes static, single-hand gestures for ISL alphabets (A-Z) and numbers (0-9).

Works in real-time using just a standard laptop webcam.

Includes image processing to handle different lighting conditions in a room.

* What it doesn't do (Out of Scope):

It does not yet recognize dynamic gestures (movements or full sentences).

It currently focuses on one-handed signs, not complex two-handed gestures.

It is a desktop application, not a mobile app (yet)

## 👥 Who is this for?
* The Deaf Community: To help them communicate independently with people who don't know sign language.

* Beginners Learning ISL: Students can use it to practice their signs and get instant feedback on whether they are doing them correctly.

* Public Service Staff: Receptionists or bank tellers could use this tool on their counters to assist deaf customers

## 🚀 Key Features
* Instant Translation: The system watches the hand and prints the corresponding letter instantly, removing the need for a human translator for basic spelling.

* Smart Guidance: It draws a "Blue Box" on the screen to show the user exactly where to place their hand for the best results.

* Confidence Score: It doesn't just guess; it tells you how sure it is (e.g., "80% confident") so you know if the translation is reliable.

* Runs on Any Laptop: I optimized the code to run smoothly on a standard CPU, so you don't need a powerful gaming computer to use it.
